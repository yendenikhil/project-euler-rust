# Puzzle Solving - Project Euler

Learning the Rust by solving the puzzles in on project euler.
I am hoping that I will learn more about the rust structuring, and 
learn about the algorithms. 

# Problems

## Problem 17 [#](https://projecteuler.net/problem=17)

To count the letters of numbers from 1 to 1000, the difficult part was 
writing the spellings properly. No fancy algorithm. Just count the letters
one by one for each number from 1.
